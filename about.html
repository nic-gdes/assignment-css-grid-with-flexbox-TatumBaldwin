                <p class="aboutparagraph"> In these uncertain times, the need for a dedicated, honest, and knowledgeable realtor has never been greater. Meet Sheri Tilton, a real estate professional committed to guiding you through the challenges of today's market. While some realtors are exploring other career options, Sheri is digging in her heels, working tirelessly to meet and exceed her clients' expectations.
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">
                    Sheri's unique background sets her apart. With six years of experience in building and excavation, she brings a wealth of knowledge to the real estate world. She's no stranger to the nitty-gritty details, having installed drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines herself. Sheri can distinguish between roofing materials, explain radon systems, and assess the feasibility of adding that extra bathroom in your basement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">
                    Her excavation expertise is invaluable for those considering raw land for their dream home. She understands soil types, optimal slopes for daylight walk-out basements, and the importance of sun exposure when designing a home. Sheri's love for horses adds another dimension to her skill set, making her an excellent choice for equestrian property seekers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">
                    Sheri's commitment to excellence has earned her a reputation for going the extra mile, resulting in 90% of her business coming from referrals. She's not just a realtor; she's a trusted advisor, dedicated to fulfilling your real estate needs and expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">
                    But Sheri is more than just a professional; she's a wife of 35 years and a proud mother of two sons. Her family-oriented perspective allows her to understand the importance of schools and location when helping you find the perfect home. When she's not working hard in the real estate field, you'll find her riding her beloved mule, Samule, or spending time with her horses and Yorkshire Terriers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutparagraph">
                    Sheri's promise to you is simple: she'll go the extra mile to make your real estate journey as smooth and stress-free as possible. Get to know her, and you'll discover a dedicated, knowledgeable, and caring realtor ready to help you achieve your real estate dreams.
                    </p>
